/** \defgroup ai_procedurals Procedural API
 * 
 * Implementation of custom Arnold procedural nodes.
 * 
 *  \details
 * This API is used to create geometry procedurally at render time, rather than
 * upfront. This is accomplished by providing the renderer some callback functions
 * which are called during scene initialization, before rendering. Procedural nodes
 * should only contain geometry, shaders and lights.
 *
 * Note that procedurals can recursively create other procedural nodes.
 *
 * Procedurals are loaded during the pre-render initialization process. This process
 * runs single-threaded by default, but setting the metadata "parallel_init" to true will
 * allow multiple instances of the same procedural to be initialized in parallel when 
 * "options.parallel_node_init" is true (the default)
 * 
 * \code
 * node_parameters
 * {
 *  ...
 *    // Set procedural to run in parallel
 *    AiMetaDataSetBool(nentry, "", "parallel_init", true);
 *  ...
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * So, in order to benefit from this parallel initialization, it is necessary that
 * the code in a procedural node is properly designed to be re-entrant.

 * (for example, bounding boxes, points, or polygons). The optional params allows you to pass in 
 * a variable number of paramater values to the method.
 *
 * This is an example of some code to get this representation from a procedural "proc":
 * \code
 * // Create new universe to store the proxy representation
 * AtUniverse* view_universe = AiUniverse();
 * 
 * // Obtain bounding-box representation (one box for each object in the procedural)
 * AtParamValueMap* params = AiParamValueMap();
 * AiParamValueMapSetInt(params, AtString("param"), 0);  // Example parameter
 * AiProceduralViewport(proc, view_universe, AI_PROC_BOXES, params);
 * AiParamValueMapDestroy(params);
 * 
 * // After that, we can iterate over those nodes and get any kind of information
 * AtNodeIterator* it = AiUniverseGetNodeIterator(view_universe, AI_NODE_SHAPE);
 * while (!AiNodeIteratorFinished(it))
 * {
 *    AtNode* node = AiNodeIteratorGetNext(it);
 *    printf("Node name: %s\n", AiNodeGetName(node));
 * }
 * AiNodeIteratorDestroy(it);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Optional parameters allow further configuration of the representation:
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>Supported optional parameters
 * <tr><td> *None yet*
 * </table>
 * 
 * \param node              This is the source node itself
 * \param universe          The universe where the new nodes will be created. A valid
 *                          universe pointer needs to be passed. If null, this function
 *                          will return with an error
 * \param mode              The type of primitives used for the viewport representation
 * \param params            List of optional parameters to be interpreted by the procedurals
 * \return                  AI_SUCCESS if no error, an error value otherwise

 * Ensure a procedural node is ready to be used for rendering.

 * This method initializes and updates a procedural node, making sure all its children are loaded. If
 * called during render, it will ensure the procedural contents are also updated and ready for render.
 * 
 * One way this API can be useful is when a procedural needs to access the contents of another procedural
 * during its initialization. e.g. procedural1 tries to create an instance of a node contained in
 * procedural2. This could be problematic with parallel scene initialization, since it doesn't guarantee
 * a specific ordering, and procedural1 might end up being initialized before procedural2. In order to
 * fix this, procedural2 can be explicitly initialized using this API, before accessing its contents.
 * 
 * If this API is called before a render session was created, the target procedural needs to handle this
 * case and avoid accessing the non-existent render session. Built-in procedurals are safe to use.
